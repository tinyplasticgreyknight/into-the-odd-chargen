This is a character generator for the _Into the Odd_ roleplaying game.

Running
-------
You can run the OddCharacters.py script to generate a single character, which is printed to standard output.
You can give a number on the command line to generate multiple characters at once (useful for GMs).

Interoperativity
----------------
The output should be suitable for loading via YAML if you want to manipulate it in some other automated tool.
