This is a character generator for the Into the Odd roleplaying game.

You can run the OddCharacters.py script to generate a single character, which is printed to standard output.
You can give a number on the command line to generate multiple characters at once (useful for GMs).

The output should be suitable for loading via YAML if you want to manipulate it in some other automated tool.
